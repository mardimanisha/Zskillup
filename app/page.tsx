 * Homepage.
 *
 * Section order is locked by the brief's Final Homepage Flow, and the narrative
 * logic behind it is:
 *
 *   Brand -> Choice -> Offerings -> Philosophy -> Proof -> People -> Activity
 *   -> Questions -> Conversion
 *
 * Heading hierarchy: the Hero headline is the page's only H1; every section
 * headline is an H2; cards and sub-sections use H3.
 *
 * HomepageStats sits between Hero and Leadership as a later, explicit addition -
 * a compact credibility strip, not part of the original locked flow above.
 * It carries no heading of its own, so it doesn't participate in the H1/H2
 * hierarchy.

 * So there are exactly two blocks, and nothing speculative:
 *   - Organization, describing ZSkillup itself.
 *   - FAQPage, covering ONLY the general question set - the questions actually
 *     visible when the page loads. Category-filtered questions are deliberately
 *     excluded rather than stuffed in.
 *
 * No aggregateRating, no review markup, no course/offer markup: none of those
 * could be stated accurately from verified data today.
