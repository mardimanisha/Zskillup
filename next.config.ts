/**
 * Static export, for GitHub Pages.
 *
 * GitHub Pages serves files, not a Node server, so the site is pre-rendered to
 * plain HTML. Two consequences to be aware of when moving to a real host later
 * (Vercel, or any Node host) - both are reversed by deleting this block:
 *
 *   1. Route handlers do not run. `/api/enquiry` is therefore not part of this
 *      build, and the enquiry form falls back to opening a pre-filled email
 *      instead of POSTing. See components/sections/EnquiryForm.tsx.
 *   2. next/image optimisation is off, so images are served at their natural
 *      size rather than as generated WebP/AVIF. Sizes/alt/dimensions are all
 *      still declared, so nothing shifts - it is purely a bytes-on-the-wire cost.
 *
 * `basePath` must match the repository name, because the site is served from
 * https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/ rather than from a domain root. Point
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH at "" if you later attach a custom domain.
