/**
 * 01 - HERO
 *
 * Per the updated design: full-bleed campus photograph running behind the
 * navigation, the headline sweeping purple-to-coral on each line, one circled
 * handwritten note, and three pathway cards overlapping the photograph's lower
 * edge.
 *
 * The CTA reads "Explore What We Offer" rather than "Explore Our Programs",
 * because "Programs" is no longer part of the site architecture. It scrolls
 * straight to Choose Your Route.
 *
 * Only one handwritten note appears here, and only one more on the whole page
 * (B.Com + ACCA) - the brief caps them and the updated designs dropped the rest.
 */

/** The hero's horizontal gutter, shared by its text and its cards row (flat, uncapped - see the note in Hero).
 *
 * `translate-x-4` (16px) is a deliberate nudge, not part of the flat-gutter
 * system described below: the navbar's logo artwork (zskillup-logo.png) has
 * ~16px of transparent padding baked into its canvas before the visible
 * mark starts, so the logo's own box edge (which this gutter otherwise
 * matches exactly) sits to the left of where the mark visibly begins. Rather
 * than touching the shared logo asset/component, the hero content is nudged
 * right by that same amount so it lines up with the logo as it's actually
 * rendered.
 *
 * Because the translate shifts the whole padded box right without widening
 * it, a plain symmetric `px` leaves the right edge 2x the nudge (32px)
 * closer to the viewport edge than the left edge sits from it - the uneven
 * left/right spacing this fixes. The right padding is bumped by that same
 * 32px (2x the 16px nudge) so the visual gap on the right matches the left
 * again once the translate is applied. */

      {/* The "photo band" - a shared positioning/clipping context for the
          background photo AND the cards row below it, so the photo's own
          box (auto-height, driven by its normal-flow content) naturally
          extends past the text content to the cards' actual rendered
          bottom edge, not just the nav+headline zone above them.

          This is deliberately ONE wrapper around BOTH pieces, not two
          separate ones: the cards row still overlaps upward into the text
          zone via its own negative margin-top exactly as before (untouched
          - see that wrapper's own comment), but a negative margin only
          affects the cards' own rendered position, not how much flow
          height they still contribute to what comes after them - so this
          wrapper's own auto height (nav+headline content, MINUS the cards'
          own overlap, PLUS the cards' own full height) already lands
          exactly on the cards' bottom edge with no measuring or magic
          numbers needed, and stays correct automatically if card content
          or breakpoint ever changes their rendered height. The footer row
          below stays a sibling OUTSIDE this wrapper, on the page's own
          white background, unaffected. */}

            content/media.ts. object-position keeps the "More Than a Degree"
            note and the student in frame as the band's own aspect ratio
            changes by viewport. Below 1024px the crop is narrow enough
            (both on phone-width mobile and on tablet) that 80%/24% is the
            one X/Y pair that keeps both her and the note in frame at once -
            higher X pushes the note out of frame toward the left edge,
            lower X pushes her toward/past the right edge.

            The `lg` X value (8%, not a centered-looking number) only matters
            between 1024px and ~1332px: below 1024 the shared mobile/tablet
            value applies, and above ~1332 the band becomes wide enough
            relative to this photo's own aspect ratio that `cover` shows its
            full width with zero horizontal crop - at that point X has no
            effect at all, it's simply the whole image, so there's nothing to
            tune further up there. In that 1024-1332px band, though, the crop
            is still live, and a higher X (centering on the student, as the
            values below 1024px do) pulls the note far enough left to
            collide with the headline. Lower X shows more open sky instead,
            pushing the note and buildings further right, clear of the text
            column.

            object-cover (unchanged) is what lets this box grow taller
            without distorting or stretching the photo - a taller box just
            reveals more of the same image, cropped the same way `cover`
            already crops it horizontally.

            1's left edge and card 3's right edge always land exactly on
            the same grid line the headline starts from and the text
            column's own right-hand boundary respects, at every viewport,
            with no drift and no guessed offset. A dedicated capped/centred
            max-width (the previous approach) was rejected here for the
            same reason it's rejected on the headline above: centring
            within a cap makes the left edge march rightward past that
            cap's width, which is exactly the misalignment this pass fixes.

            gap-10 (was gap-8) is the lever for "narrower, more separated
            cards" now that the row has no independent max-width of its own
            to shrink: a bigger gap directly hands less of the row's total
            width to each card, at every viewport, without touching card
            content, padding or the button-fit tuning below. */}

              brand mark as that same small block instead of a pill (the

              inseparable second line, so it no longer fits inline the way a
              single-line wordmark did). Both pills share this exact
              template - font size, weight (normal - deliberately NOT
              inheriting the h2's font-bold, since a bold pill read as a
              different kind of label than institutions' non-bold one),

              up - the brief's own "one line" requirement is scoped to
              desktop. Below `sm`, the single-column card is its full
              (generous) width already comfortably wraps the eyebrow with no
              cap needed, but at base-tier phone widths specifically
              (~320-415px, checked in-browser, not guessed - covers most
              real phones) the card itself is narrower than the unwrapped

      {/* Five width tiers, keyed to the row's TRUE available budget at each
          (article width minus card padding minus the indent), re-measured
          in-browser - not guessed - against card 3's own longest combination
          ("Explore" + "Talk to an Advisor" + "Watch Now"), the tightest of
          the three cards at every tier:

            - base (<420px): 10px type, no indent.
            - min-420: 11px type, indent up to 32px.
            - sm (640px+): 15px type, indent up to 80px - the width of the
              icon above plus its gap, so the buttons line up under the text.
            - min-900: 16px type - the same size as the hero's own
              "Explore What We Offer" CTA.
            - xl (1280px+, 3-across): 11px type again, in much narrower cards,
              indent up to 32px.

          Horizontal padding. The hero CTA is size="lg": px-7 = 28px on 16px
          type = 1.75em. `--hx` is how much wider EACH side of EVERY button in
          this row gets on top of its tier's original padding (the literals in
          the calc()s below), capped where the plain buttons reach that same
          1.75em (14.5 / 11.25 / 10.25 / 8 / 13.25px per tier) - so it is
          exactly the CTA's 28px at min-900, where the type size matches too.

          Each row was already full to within a few px on the first pixel of
          a tier (card 3: ~3px at 420, ~-2px at 640, ~11px at 1280) and gets
          roomier the wider the card goes, so `--hx` is not a fixed step: it is
          (100cqw - K) / 6, clamped to 0..cap. The row below is a size
          container, so `cqw` is its own exact width - whatever tier, grid
          column or scrollbar produced it, with no viewport arithmetic. Six
          is the number of padded sides on card 3's row when every one of them grows (Watch Now's left side no longer does, which only adds slack); K is the row width
          at which card 3 (the longest labels) would exactly fill it at the
          OLD padding with no indent (base 255, min-420 320, sm 464, xl 301),
          plus ~3px of safety. All three cards share the one value, so all
          three buttons stay on one line at every width and every card's
          buttons stay identical - without shrinking the padding to force it.

          The indent (the spacer) is the only thing that yields, and only
          when the row is pinched: it is whatever room is left once `--hx`
          has reached its cap (K + 6 x cap), so it is 0 at the start of
          min-420 and xl and back to its full original width a little
          higher. The old gap between spacer and buttons is folded into its
          width. The gaps BETWEEN buttons are untouched.

          `!` (important) is required on the buttons/pill below - these
          override Button's own shared `sm` size and VideoDialog's own shared
          `pill` padding, neither of which this pass may edit directly (both
          are used elsewhere on the site, unchanged). flex-nowrap is
          unconditional (no flex-wrap fallback at any width): the li/article
          above are both min-w-0 so an over-budget row can never blow out the
          grid track or the page - it's the padding/indent budget above that
          makes nowrap actually fit.

          Arbitrary breakpoints stay in px up to min-900 and hand over to
          `xl:` (rem) after that - Tailwind sorts px arbitrary variants ahead
          of rem ones, so `xl:` always wins where both apply. */}
