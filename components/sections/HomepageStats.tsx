/**
 * CREDIBILITY STRIP - sits directly between Hero and About.
 *
 * A compact row of six figures, now introduced by its own eyebrow/heading/
 * supporting copy - "Real People. Real Progress." - per the reference this
 * was built from. Kept as its own lightweight section (not the shared
 * <Section> shell) because that component's standard py-20/24/28 vertical
 * padding reads as too generous for how compact the reference's own
 * spacing is; this strip uses its own tighter rhythm instead.
 *
 * "Leading" in the heading reuses the site's existing handwritten accent
 * (Caveat, via the shared `Handwritten` component/`.handwritten` CSS class,
 * swoosh underline included) rather than a plain italic sans fallback - the
 * only script/serif-flavoured treatment already in the type system, and
 * this is the accent's 3rd use on the homepage (the brief's own cap is
 * "2-3" - see globals.css and Stats.tsx).
 *
 * The outer field is `bg-white` - the same tone About ZSkillup uses
 * (`<Section tone="white">`), per the brief. The light cards pick up a
 * `border-line` hairline (not carried before, when `bg-cloud` alone did
 * that job) so they still read as distinct cards against a same-toned page
 * rather than flattening into it. Figures are `text-navy`, the same
 * "black" the rest of the site's dark text uses, rather than a literal
 * `text-black` this design system doesn't otherwise use anywhere.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the shared <Container> (max-w-[1240px]): six cards in one
 * row leaves each just ~179px wide inside that width - checked directly
 * against this layout, that's too narrow for the longest label ("Universities
 * & Colleges onboarded") to read comfortably. A dedicated, wider max-width -
 * the same fix the Hero cards row uses for the same reason - gives every
 * card real room to spare once six-across is safe.
 *
 * Six-across only switches on at 1450px (checked directly against this
 * content, not guessed), not at the `lg` grid's usual 1024px: below that,
 * six cards genuinely can't hold their labels at a legible size no matter
 * how the width is redistributed, so the strip stays 3x2 for every width
 * from tablet up through smaller desktop screens, and only becomes a single
 * row once there's genuinely enough room for it.
 *
 * The 3-up and 6-up breakpoints below both use `min-[Npx]:` rather than the
 * named `sm:` - mixing a named breakpoint with an arbitrary one on the same
 * property compiles fine but loses the cascade at wide viewports (both
 * conditions end up true at once, and the named variant's rule sorts after
 * the arbitrary one regardless of which is visually wider, so `sm:` silently
 * wins and 1450px+ never applies). Sticking to `min-[]:` throughout keeps
 * every tier sorted by its actual pixel value, so the widest matching
 * breakpoint reliably wins.
 *
 * ONE HIGHLIGHTED CARD: `stat.highlight` (content/stats.ts) marks exactly
 * one figure ("Placements") to render on the brand-purple fill instead of
 * white - the one deliberate accent among six otherwise-uniform cards, per
 * the reference this was built from. Every other card stays white/light;
 * this is not a per-card colour system.
 *
 * CARD ARTWORK: each stat's `image` (content/stats.ts) is the officially
 * supplied card visual, not an icon this component draws itself - every
 * file already bakes in its own rounded-card look (and, for "Placements",
 * the purple highlight fill), so the card is just that image plus the
 * number/label overlaid on top, not a second background/border/shadow of
 * this component's own layered underneath it (that would double up on what
 * the artwork already provides). `fill` + `object-contain` inside an
 * `aspect-square` box shows each image at its own natural proportions,
 * uncropped, regardless of how close to 1:1 any particular file's own
 * dimensions are - `aspect-square` also gives all six cards the same
 * footprint without the min-h reservations the previous icon-drawn version
 * needed. The number/label sit in the blank upper portion every supplied
 * image already reserves for them - a purely decorative fill, so `alt=""`.
 *
 * COUNT-UP ANIMATION: each figure parses into a numeric target plus the
 * exact prefix/suffix text around it (" LPA", "+", "%" and so on) and how
 * many decimal places it originally had (one for "5.6 LPA", zero for every
 * other figure) - so intermediate frames re-attach the same prefix/suffix
 * and decimal precision the final value has, and the animation can never
 * land on anything but the exact original string. Triggered once, by a
 * single IntersectionObserver on the whole strip (not one per card, so all
 * six start together) - it disconnects itself the moment it fires, which is
 * what guarantees "play once" and rules out a restart from scrolling away
 * and back. `prefers-reduced-motion` skips the animation and renders the
 * final values immediately, consistent with how decorative (not user-
 * driven) motion is handled elsewhere on this site. */

/** Every card is `aspect-square` now (see below), so height parity across
    the row no longer needs the min-h reservation the previous icon-drawn
    version relied on - the card's own footprint is fixed regardless of how
    many lines a given label wraps to.

    The base (2-column, <640px) tier is deliberately smaller than the sm+
    tiers: at that width the card itself is only ~150-160px square, and the
    longest labels ("Universities & Colleges onboarded", "Placement Success
    Rate") wrap to 3 and 2 lines respectively - at the old base size that
    text block ran tall enough to visually collide with the supplied

    only (sm+ unchanged) buys back enough vertical room to clear it without
