/**
 * 03 - CHOOSE YOUR ROUTE
 *
 * Per the updated design, the whole card carries its vertical's tint (rather
 * than sitting white on a tinted page), with a soft decorative circle in the
 * corner, a circular icon well, and a full-width CTA in the vertical's colour.
 * "Outcome: Employability" closes every card in a slightly deeper band - which is
 * what ties the three routes back to one ZSkillup proposition.
 *
 * The headline accent is the editorial gold used across Choose Your Route,
 * Partners and Testimonials.
 *
 * Still removed, per the brief: the left-hand statistics, "Skills Today.
 * Opportunities Tomorrow.", and any extra left-column CTA. The three card CTAs
 * are enough.
