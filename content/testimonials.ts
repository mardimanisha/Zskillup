 * #   The first three entries are carried over verbatim from the approved    #
 * #   design comp, where they were placeholder copy. The remaining three     #
 * #   were written in the same style to satisfy the brief's requirement to   #
 * #   "deliberately mix testimonials from Institutional Programs + Prephasz  #
 * #   + Commerce/B.Com + ACCA".                                              #

 * #   NONE of these are real learner quotes. Every one must be replaced with #
 * #   an authentic, consented testimonial - with the learner's real name,    #
 * #   programme and institution - before this section goes live.             #
 * #                                                                         #

 *
 * Brief rules encoded here:
 *   - 35-50 words per testimonial on the homepage.
 *   - Card shows: Photo | Name | Programme/Role | Institution.
 *   - Small category label per card, mixed across all three offerings.
 *   - NO star ratings. "Stars should only appear if these are actual ratings
 *     given by the learner" - there is no rating data, so there is no `rating`
 *     field and no stars are rendered.
 *   - NO top statistics strip (500+ / 4.8/5 / 90% were removed).

/**
 * ORDER MATTERS, for two reasons at once.
 *
 * The brief asks that the carousel "deliberately mix testimonials from
 * Institutional Programs + Prephasz + Commerce/B.Com + ACCA, rather than making
 * all three visible stories belong to one offering" - AND that the learner
 * photographs are kept, because they are what make the section credible.
 *
 * The updated design resolves those together: the three photographed learners
 * lead, labelled across all three offerings. So the first three entries are the
 * ones with photographs, in commerce -> institutions -> prephasz order. Keep that
 * rotation when adding entries rather than appending by offering.
