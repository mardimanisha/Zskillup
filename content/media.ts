 *  So the site shows the intended artwork, not stand-ins.
 *
 *  They are COMP-RESOLUTION - cropped out of flat PNG renders of the designs.
 *  For production, replace each file with the original full-resolution asset at

 *
 *  `width`/`height` are declared on every slot so swapping images causes zero
