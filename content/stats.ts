 *  THE BRIEF'S STATISTICS RULE, ENCODED
 *
 *  "Use only verified, defensible numbers. Do not hard-code placeholder claims."
 *  "All claims, ratings, partner counts, learner counts and outcome numbers must
 *   be verified before publishing."
 *
 *  So every stat carries a `verified` flag:
 *
 *    verified: true   -> supplied in the brief, or makes no measurable claim.
 *                        Always renders.
 *    verified: false  -> carried over from the design comps but NOT yet validated.
 *                        Renders in development so the team can review the intended
 *                        layout; HIDDEN IN PRODUCTION BUILDS so an unverified claim
 *                        cannot be published by accident.
 *
 *  To publish an unverified stat: confirm the real figure, update `value`, then
 *  set `verified: true`. To preview them in a production build, set
 *  NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_UNVERIFIED_STATS=true.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  Placement rules, also from the brief:
 *    - NO corporate statistics strip in the Hero.
 *    - NO corporate statistics in Choose Your Route or About.
 *    - Partners is the primary (and only) home for corporate scale statistics.
 *    - Events uses ACTIVITY-specific statistics only - never partner or learner counts.
