/**
 * 08 - PARTNERS
 *
 * The brief's overriding objective for this section: it must SCALE.
 * "We should be able to go from 20 to 100+ institutions/companies later without
 *  requiring any redesign of the homepage."
 *
 * So: add entries to the arrays below and the carousel absorbs them. Nothing else
 * changes. The homepage deliberately shows a window onto the network, not a
 * directory.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  LOGOS
 *  Institutional logos below are the marks shown in the approved Partners comp,
 *  extracted by `scripts/extract-comp-assets.py`. They are comp-resolution -
 *  replace with vector originals at the same paths for production.
 *
 *  `logo` is optional. When it is absent the tile falls back to an accessible
 *  wordmark built from the partner's name, so the section stays complete and
 *  crawlable for entries with no artwork yet.
 *
 *  Third-party logos need permission before publishing - see CONTENT-TODO.md.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Tab 2 - Industry & Hiring Network. Companies and employers ONLY.
 *
 * The brief prefers "Industry & Hiring Network" over "Hiring Partners" precisely
 * because not every company shown is formally a hiring partner. Keep that label.
 *
 * Names below are the recruiters ZSkillup/Prephasz already reference publicly.
 * Logo files are official artwork, trimmed to their content bounding box and
 * downscaled (source files ranged from 185px to 4464px wide) - never
 * recoloured or redrawn. Confirm naming permission before publishing - see
 * CONTENT-TODO.md.
 *
 * Deloitte has no `logo` yet - the supplied source file has a third-party
 * "cleanpng.com" watermark baked into opaque pixels (not a transparent
 * preview artifact - sampled pixels confirmed a literal checkerboard +
 * watermark-text pattern), so it isn't genuine artwork suitable for a
 * production site. Falls back to the wordmark tile, same as before, until a
 * clean file is supplied.
